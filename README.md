notes:

1) download the html, css and the icon png file found at the above link to your local machine.

2) add your CSS code to the css file as instructed in the readme file.

3) create a GitHub repo and deploy your project to the internet and submit to Canvas a PDF file with links to the repo and the deployed URL. Make sure the links are HYPERLINKS, so that I or the grader can click on them and be directed to your repo/deployed link!

Ask questions on Discord! :-)

# Typesetting a community school page 


##### this homework assignment is based on the material on [MDN website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Typesetting_a_homepage)


ðŸŒ± For a quality learning experience, please, make sure you have reviewed the following articles on MDN prior to doing this HW:

- [Fundamental text and font styling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Text_styling/Fundamentals)
- [Styling lists](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Text_styling/Styling_lists)

- [Web fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Text_styling/Web_fonts)




ðŸš€To get this assignment started, you should download the files in this directory to your local computer. You need to download index.html, style.css and the external-link-52.png file included here. 

## Deliverables ðŸ“¬

Please submit to Canvas a PDF file that contains two hyperlinks:
1. a link to the GitHub repo, so I can see your code.
2. a link to the deployed website (you can try any service to deploy your project, GitHub Pages, Netlify, Render, Glitch, etc!)

## Project brief

You've been provided with some raw HTML for the homepage of an imaginary community college, plus some CSS that styles the page into a three column layout and provides some other rudimentary styling. You're to **write your CSS additions below the comment at the bottom of the CSS file and at the very top of the given file** to make sure it's easy to mark the parts you've done. Don't worry if some of the selectors are repetitious; we'll let you off in this instance.


### Fonts:

First of all, choose a couple of free-to-use (Google!) fonts. If you have access to adobe creative cloud, check fonts there too! Because this is a college, the fonts should be chosen to give the page a fairly serious, formal, trustworthy feel: a serif site-wide font for the general body text, coupled with a sans-serif or slab serif for the headings might be nice.
Apply your body font to the whole page, and your heading font to your headings.


### General text styling:

1. Give the page a site-wide font-size of 10px (~ 0.625 rem | 1 rem = 16px).

2. Give your headings and other element types appropriate font-sizes defined using a suitable relative unit.

3. Give your body text a suitable line-height.

4. Center your top level heading on the page.

5. Give your headings a little bit of letter-spacing to make them not too squashed, and allow the letters to breathe a bit.

6. Give your body text some letter-spacing and word-spacing, as appropriate.

7. Give the first paragraph after each heading in the <code> \<section\> </code> a little bit of text-indentation, say 1.25 rem. (hint: css property <code>text-indent</code>)

### Links:

1. Give the link, <code>visited, focus, and hover</code> states some colors that go with the color of the horizontal bars at the top and bottom of the page.

2. Make it so that links are underlined by default, but when you hover or focus them the underline disappears.

3. Remove the default focus outline from ALL the links on the page.

4. Give the active state a noticeably different styling so it stands out nicely, but make it still fit in with the overall page design.

5. Make it so that external links have the external link icon inserted next to them.

### Lists:

1. Make sure the spacing of your lists and list items works well with the styling of the overall page. 

2. Each list item should have the same line-height as a paragraph line, and each list should have the same spacing at its top and bottom as you have between paragraphs.

3. Give your list items a nice bullet appropriate for the design of the page. It is up to you whether you choose a custom bullet image or something else.


### Navigation menu:

Style your navigation menu so that it harmonizes with the page.

### Hints and tips

- <em>You must not edit the HTML in any way for this exercise.</em>

- You don't necessarily have to make the nav menu look like buttons, but it needs to be a bit taller so that it doesn't look silly on the side of the page; also remember that you need to make this one a vertical nav menu.
